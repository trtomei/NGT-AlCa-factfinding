The "offline" database leaves in P5, it's the "bible". 
We have a clone (ADG) that's accessible from the world. 
The "online" DB is kind of an appendix of the detector (temperature, voltage). 	
It has a different database schema, it needs some transformation (O2O) to go into the offline DB and be able to be read in CMSSW.
